## Profile Summary
I am a student/apprentice at TLG Learning, currently learning to become a DevOps engineer. My goal is to eventually work as a DevOps Specialist at DRW. I have a passion for coding, rock climbing, playing billiards, and attending hackathons. I also enjoy volunteering with Code Nation. On free weekends as well as listening to WU-TANG

## Side Projects

### bin-hex
This project was created to practice translating binary and hexadecimal numbers using Python.

### GoWeatherApp
GoWeatherApp was developed to learn Golang, practice switch casing, and work with APIs within the language.

### GoogleTriviaProject
During my time as a student at Google's fellowship program with Code Nation, I created this web app using React. It allowed me to learn and utilize the React framework effectively.

### Form-practice
Form-practice is an application developed to understand the Flask framework in Python and integrate it with Bootstrap. This project helped me gain knowledge in handling GET/POST requests and displaying them differently.

### hangmanForDocker
I created hangmanForDocker to learn how to use Docker to containerize a small application like Hangman. This project also involved deploying the application along with its dependencies.

## What's to Come
In the future, I plan to work on repositories that will enhance my understanding of Ansible, Terraform, Kubernetes, AWS, and CI/CD pipelines.
